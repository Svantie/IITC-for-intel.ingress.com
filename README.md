# IITC-for-intel.ingress.com

Not to long ago NIA changed the intel adress from ingress.com/intel to intel.ingress.com
due to this change IITC and a lot of plugins arent working anymore.

In this repository you find IITC itself and a bunch of plugins.
In the sourcodes of IITC and it's plugins i change the intel URL's to: intel.ingress.com
